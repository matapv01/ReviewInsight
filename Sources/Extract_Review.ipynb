      "Đánh giá 1: Buying a used phone can be an anxiety filled experience - you read the reviews and hope that you're one of the happy customers and are lucky enough to get an \"as advertised product.\" You have to take a chance. I did and the phone arrived quickly and with an unexpected charger and cord - generic box and bubble wrap. The phone was listed as in \"excellent\" and it truly was without a mark, dent or scratch.\n",
      "Several hours of backing up, transferring data and sim - now the phone is truly working and picking up where the prior phone handed off to the latest one.\n",
      "The challenge of course is you have a new phone - and its always a bit steep for the first few days trying to learn the new hardware/software and audit that the used phone does not have some hidden defect that is going to cost you more time and money. So, I'm happy for a few days and then one evening I discover that the bottom speaker (the top earpiece speaker is actually called the receiver) was not working well. scratchy and little to no volume - this had missed my attention entirely. A panic search online revealed Apple 12 speaker problems and them being repaired by Apple - crap!\n",
      "I went to a repair shop the next day, they ran Apple diagnostics on the phone and sure enough - speaker needed to be replaced - $120 for generic parts, $180 for Apple parts - they're not familiar with the Apple repair program (found out later that was for receiver speakers) - so this is half of the cost of the phone.\n",
      "No I'm committed to the new phone, don't want to lose it, but don't want to pay this either.\n",
      "Reach out to seller and explain the issue - they can even confirm the Apple diagnostic through the serial number - They offer $25 refund if I'll keep the phone. - So this tells me that they don't run diagnostics on the phones themselves - or do and hope that people will simply miss small items or accept them once they have sweat equity in the phone - or, it's all honest and by buying/selling a used phone both parties are taking a gamble. I chose to believe the latter. And accepted their offer.\n",
      "And here's the takeaway - the speaker now works - once in a while I might think I hear some scratchy, but unsure due to surrounding conditions. So for now, it's good, we'll see how long it lasts - but if I have to get it repaired - I took a chance -\n",
      "I say take a chance - you might get a perfect phone and save a lot in the meantime - I typically stay a few models behind the curve and benefit from software updates and people abandoning perfectly working phones for the latest models - AT&T typically had new old stock and I took advantage of that, but I have a grandfathered plan that they no longer make good money on, so I'm no longer eligible for that.\n",

Screen and display are flawless, phone is in excellent condition and all features work properly. Charging port of the phone works properly, speakers are loud and clear, buttons are solid, haptics crisp. Battery Health is 88% and stable. Got same day delivery and up and running quickly. Purchased refurb level was “excellent”. Should have been my first stop..\n",

      "I purchased another phone days before from a different seller based on amount of sales and ratings.\n",
      "Refurb level was “Premium” waited a few days and once received phone came with a faulty charging port, display was showing in settings as “unknown” or issue with hardware. So in the return box this goes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of these refurbished phones are due to cracked screens. Some companies will use non-genuine apple products during the repair. So be prepared this may be an issue when you receive your phone from some refurb sellers. I personally will not accept it and if I’m paying a premium dollar amount for a 3 or 4 year old phone I expect it to be repaired with genuine iPhone parts. Not to mention I don’t appreciate caution notifications every time I go into my settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the phone I received from this seller was flawless with no issues and fully wiped. The other thing is when you receive your phone it should be completely wiped and ready for set up. If it is not! Do NOT connect it to any of your devices, specifically computers or your wifi before the factory reset.\n",

      "\n",
      "My biggest concern is with the packaging. The phone was simply placed inside the cardboard insert with no foam sleeve or protection (as shown in 1st picture). You can see there’s about a 1/2 inch of wiggle room with nothing holding it in place, meaning it was very likely sliding around the cardboard during transit. Luckily I didn’t notice any major damage or scratches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another smaller concern is that the phone was visibly not thoroughly cleaned. The smudges and marks easily came off, but you can see some grime along the side edges (refer to pictures). I was hoping for a higher standard of cleanliness with Amazon’s highest option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Otherwise, the phone does work great and feels almost brand new. I’ve tested all the features with no problems and was pleasantly surprised to see the battery health was at 94%, which is really good considering phones generally degrade to around 90-80% (depending on use) after a year or two.\n",
