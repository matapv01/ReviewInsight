1,"Buying a used phone can be an anxiety filled experience - you read the reviews and hope that you're one of the happy customers and are lucky enough to get an ""as advertised product."" You have to take a chance. I did and the phone arrived quickly and with an unexpected charger and cord - generic box and bubble wrap. The phone was listed as in ""excellent"" and it truly was without a mark, dent or scratch.
Several hours of backing up, transferring data and sim - now the phone is truly working and picking up where the prior phone handed off to the latest one.
The challenge of course is you have a new phone - and its always a bit steep for the first few days trying to learn the new hardware/software and audit that the used phone does not have some hidden defect that is going to cost you more time and money. So, I'm happy for a few days and then one evening I discover that the bottom speaker (the top earpiece speaker is actually called the receiver) was not working well. scratchy and little to no volume - this had missed my attention entirely. A panic search online revealed Apple 12 speaker problems and them being repaired by Apple - crap!
I went to a repair shop the next day, they ran Apple diagnostics on the phone and sure enough - speaker needed to be replaced - $120 for generic parts, $180 for Apple parts - they're not familiar with the Apple repair program (found out later that was for receiver speakers) - so this is half of the cost of the phone.
No I'm committed to the new phone, don't want to lose it, but don't want to pay this either.
Reach out to seller and explain the issue - they can even confirm the Apple diagnostic through the serial number - They offer $25 refund if I'll keep the phone. - So this tells me that they don't run diagnostics on the phones themselves - or do and hope that people will simply miss small items or accept them once they have sweat equity in the phone - or, it's all honest and by buying/selling a used phone both parties are taking a gamble. I chose to believe the latter. And accepted their offer.
And here's the takeaway - the speaker now works - once in a while I might think I hear some scratchy, but unsure due to surrounding conditions. So for now, it's good, we'll see how long it lasts - but if I have to get it repaired - I took a chance -
I say take a chance - you might get a perfect phone and save a lot in the meantime - I typically stay a few models behind the curve and benefit from software updates and people abandoning perfectly working phones for the latest models - AT&T typically had new old stock and I took advantage of that, but I have a grandfathered plan that they no longer make good money on, so I'm no longer eligible for that.
Hope your experience is a good one - all the best, Don"
2,"On my journey of ordering a refurbished iPhone and it can be a journey this was an excellent purchase. Screen and display are flawless, phone is in excellent condition and all features work properly. Charging port of the phone works properly, speakers are loud and clear, buttons are solid, haptics crisp. Battery Health is 88% and stable. Got same day delivery and up and running quickly. Purchased refurb level was ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù. Should have been my first stop..

Now I did mention a journey so let me add a quick tip if this is your first time looking for a refurbed phone.

I purchased another phone days before from a different seller based on amount of sales and ratings.
Refurb level was ‚ÄúPremium‚Äù waited a few days and once received phone came with a faulty charging port, display was showing in settings as ‚Äúunknown‚Äù or issue with hardware. So in the return box this goes.

Many of these refurbished phones are due to cracked screens. Some companies will use non-genuine apple products during the repair. So be prepared this may be an issue when you receive your phone from some refurb sellers. I personally will not accept it and if I‚Äôm paying a premium dollar amount for a 3 or 4 year old phone I expect it to be repaired with genuine iPhone parts. Not to mention I don‚Äôt appreciate caution notifications every time I go into my settings.

Again the phone I received from this seller was flawless with no issues and fully wiped. The other thing is when you receive your phone it should be completely wiped and ready for set up. If it is not! Do NOT connect it to any of your devices, specifically computers or your wifi before the factory reset."
3,"I got the iPhone 12 Pro with Amazon‚Äôs ‚Äúrenewed - premium‚Äù option. The brand was ‚ÄúHybridIT‚Äù. Just got the phone today, and it‚Äôs working great and as expected so far, but do I have a few concerns.

My biggest concern is with the packaging. The phone was simply placed inside the cardboard insert with no foam sleeve or protection (as shown in 1st picture). You can see there‚Äôs about a 1/2 inch of wiggle room with nothing holding it in place, meaning it was very likely sliding around the cardboard during transit. Luckily I didn‚Äôt notice any major damage or scratches.

Another smaller concern is that the phone was visibly not thoroughly cleaned. The smudges and marks easily came off, but you can see some grime along the side edges (refer to pictures). I was hoping for a higher standard of cleanliness with Amazon‚Äôs highest option.

Otherwise, the phone does work great and feels almost brand new. I‚Äôve tested all the features with no problems and was pleasantly surprised to see the battery health was at 94%, which is really good considering phones generally degrade to around 90-80% (depending on use) after a year or two.

Keep in mind, I‚Äôm not sure if the packaging issue is a problem with Amazon renewed or HybridIT. However, all in all the phone itself is in good condition.

Hope this helps!"
4,"This is the third refurbished item I‚Äôve ordered from Amazon and all of them have been terrific, basically brand new. This battery did come in at only 80% capacity, which is the only drawback."
5,"I wanted to wait a couple months before writing a review so here it is

You get what you pay for, for sure. Phone came with an 80% battery capacity‚Ä¶ a little disappointing but it is what it is.

Then I noticed it overheats fast. Phone was still operational of course, but it was kind of just annoying.

Then finally, my imessage started cutting in and out. This was what did it for me lol. My imessage would just stop working completely for hours on end and i finally was like oooookay time for another phone.

Overall however, phone came in beautiful condition, no dents no scratches or dings and it worked great aside from my imessage going in and out. There might be just some things needing fixing upon purchase. Hope this helps!"
6,Had this phone for a year and works completely fine. Got blue went to my phone servicer and got it turned on immediately. Its legit and yes its a iphoneüíö
7,"I can‚Äôt tell the difference between the phone I received and one that‚Äôs BRAND NEW.
At first, I was concerned that I might have problems downgrading from an iPhone 14 Pro Max to the IPhone 12 Pro. But my online backup went through without any problem. Except for one small inconvenience. At first, my Echo ear buds weren‚Äôt recognized by the Bluetooth on the new phone. But after a few days they magically appeared in the Bluetooth devices. However, the Alexa feature with the earbuds hasn‚Äôt worked. I‚Äôve attempted a number of times to reset the earbuds using the Alexa app, but I keep getting an error (‚ÄúInternal Error‚Äù) when I attempt to sign in to my Amazon account. Looks like the only way I‚Äôll get through it is to call Amazon Support, but I don‚Äôt relish the idea of being on hold forever while waiting for a REAL PERSON to pickup my call.
It‚Äôs frustrating, but overall I‚Äôm very satisfied with the purchase, and would, in hindsight, buy it again."
8,"Fast shipping. Phone looks brand new, easy to set up, fully unlocked. No battery issues. I've had the phone only a few days but so far very satisfied and everything was as advertised."
9,"I did receive my item very quickly,I did have issues with it when I first bought it. I had difficulty hearing when I received or tried to call someone using the phone. I did . contact customer support. They sent a link for me to contact Apple as they were the manufacture. Apple did set me up with an appointment to have it checked out. They did fix the sound issue but also told me I had faulty microphone.. so evidently everything is not exactly checked out to make it like new when you buy a renewed phone. This was the second 12 Pro that I bought through Amazon Amazon. The first one I sent right back.. On that note, I do like the phone. I think I will try out my phone for a bit to see if I have any more issues before I see if I need to send it back , it does have a warranty . I did buy an OtterBox case for it which I like really well.. I hope this helps anyone that is looking for a phone."
10,"My 12 pro broke, and I‚Äôm too broke to buy another $1000 phone. Phone is in mint condition, and so far everything seems to be working. It loses one star as I seemed to pay on the higher end, only one day later it was $15 cheaper. Battery health was at 84% which is acceptable as my broken phones battery health was exactly the same. I will update and take Amazon on their 90 day warranty if anything negative bubbles up. Don‚Äôt goof around with 3rd party sellers with this kind of stuff."
11,"Was a little skeptical at first, but this was 100 percent worth it. The phone itself looked brand new, and came with a chord and charger. Turned on and activated with no issues what so ever. I just needed to do a full reset. Phone came with a battery life of 86% so not to bad. Well worth it."
12,"I‚Äôll preface this review by saying I am pretty picky when it comes to my possessions. My IPhone 7+ finally gave up the ghost. I was hoping to get through the remainder of this year so that when the IPhone 15 came out that I would get a renewed 14 Max Pro but that was not to be. We had purchased a renewed IPhone 12 for my son from another seller and were surprised with how clean it was when it arrived. We paid extra for the excellent condition and it was in pristine condition with a 100% battery max battery health.

Prime day comes along and I see this phone from this seller. It was roughly $200 more than the regular IPhone 12 that we bought for my son but it was the Pro model and it did have 512k of storage. Due to the positive experience we had with the earlier purchase, I decided to pull the trigger.

Fulfillment was great. I had ordered the phone on 7/11 and it was scheduled to arrive on 7/14 but to my surprise it hit my house on 7/13 which was a nice surprise.

When I picked up the package I got worried because I could hear and feel something rattling in the box that was shipped in a form fitting padded envelope. To my relief I found the phone to be intact. It arrived with protective plastic on the screen, a SIM port tool, and a lightning charging cable that was loose in the box. Upon inspection I found the screen to be free of scratches or gouges but there is some slight surface marring on a small section of the screen that you have to look for in order to see. The bezel was clean except for a couple of nicks. The worst sign of usage is a chip above the top of the highest camera lens. It‚Äôs not huge but you can definitely see it and it looks like a chip in a car windshield since the back of the phone is finished in glass. The only other thing to mention is that there was a bit of what looks like green metal tape that was poking out of the side of the phone between the screen and bezel which I was able to rub off with my fingernail. It looked like the refurb process was not as clean as it could have been.

Going into the settings I found that the max battery life was only 85% which was kind of a bummer. Setting up the phone was a breeze with ICloud but I haven‚Äôt figured out how to pull down the pictures that resided on my old phone. My apps came over but know I had to re-enter my passwords in most cases.

After only a couple of day usage, everything seems to work fine. Amazon gives 90 days to return for any issues. The camera on the pro is a definite improvement over the 7+. Size wise the unit is smaller than the 7+ but the screen is bigger on the 12 since it doesn‚Äôt have the home button at the bottom which I keep wanting to press out of habit.

Overall the purchase was better than ok. If the phone has another 10% of battery life and the nick on the camera was not present then I would rate the item as excellent. I‚Äôll always wonder if I should have purchased a phone from the other seller that sold a phone in perfect condition. I will update this review should anything major happen with the phone."
13,"So far after a couple months the phone seems to work good but the battery life is terrible, it shows it has good battery health but dies really fast"
14,"The first one I received was DOA, the second one was absolutely perfect,no marks or scratches,battery was at 93%. change over was quick and easy."
15,"I ordered the phone and everything was great until I tried to transfer my service and it didn‚Äôt work , I thought okay maybe it‚Äôs just that service provider so I used a different one that still didn‚Äôt work . I looked in my settings only to find that it had a carrier lock on it, mind you i bought this fully unlocked. I emailed them to figure what the carrier was and I haven‚Äôt heard back for weeks . After I contacted the seller assistant they reached out and immediately fixed the issue and my phone is up and running perfectly!"
16,"The item is being returned. This was a good value for the price, but unfortunately, the SIM is not compatible with Verizon. I will not wait for Verizon to send a physical SIM card. The following statement, copied from the sales page, is not true: ""Fully unlocked and compatible with any carrier of choice (e.g., AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon, US-Cellular, Cricket, Metro, etc.).""57

Update... I was able to use this phone by activating on Mint Mobile. It does not work for Verizon but this will work as an alternative."
17,"The phone is in excellent condition, as described, but the SIM card tray is missing."
18,"Lo compr√© para mi mam√° y el celular funciona muy bien, se que en celulares de segunda la calidad de bater√≠a nunca va a ser del 100%, pero el que compr√© me vino con un 82%, eso quiere decir que tendr√° que cambiar de bater√≠a muy pronto, evit√© devolverlo ya que el proceso es largo, como celular secundario funciona, pero si quieres un celular principal deber√≠as optar por algo m√°s nuevo"

20,"this is by far the best refurbished iphone ive purchased in my life . I n my opinion trademore has the best refurbished phone not only in the county , not only in the world , but the best in our galaxy. they are simply the best and the best customer servive as well. thank you for such a fantastic phone it just like new but half the price."
21,Cannot 5G signal
22,"I've recently uploaded my iPhone X to an iPhone 12 pro.
All good, except for the casing that had very minor scratches on the bottom, near the charging port, and the fact that it came with 84% battery life.
Not bad, but I was really hoping for at least 95% battery life.
Either way, I opted to keep it, instead of the hustle of returning and searching for another one."
23,The experience ordering used phones so far honestly has been satisfying. This iphone I ordered came in a box(not original obviously) properly secured along with a charge cable and block(not oem / original). I would safely say I would order again and do intend to!!!
24,"Upgrade my iPhone xr 64gb to a iPhone 12 Pro 512 gb
Went online and was able to switch over at no charge and transfer info from my other phone all in about 15 minutes. Thank you Mr Bezos"
25,"~Nearly cosmetically perfect
~No scratches on screen
~Battery health at 97%
~Everything works perfect
~The unboxing was just as satisfying as if it had been in a new Apple box
~I love it
~The only little thing I would mention is I feel like it could have been cleaned just a bit better- there was still some dust and lint in the nooks and crannies that I had to get myself, but that‚Äôs okay. Definitely worth it for everything else!"
26,"I bought the iphone 12pro 512gb in ‚Äògood‚Äô condition. The device arrived in mint condition with no visible scratches or signs or wear and no changed parts. Battery health 80% but i wanna believe thats what i paid for. Overall nice purchase!

P.S: a note to the seller, we are in 2024 so either include a decent fast charger or dont at all cz im just gonna through the extra slow cable away."
27,This was amazons own renewed product and came super clean and fully functional
28,"Phone is spotless. It came with 93% battery health. However, after 2 weeks it‚Äôs at 91% battery health."
29,Ive had the phone for about a month now and its pretty good the speakers sound weird at first but they either become normal or ive just gotten used to it. Will be updating as i go on
30,"Acabo de adquirir un 12pro de 256 renovado. Compre a Mobilesupply por su reputaci√≥n y no fallaron. Llego impecable, parece nuevo. Aparece que le reemplazaron la tapa trasera. 86% de bater√≠a. Volver√≠a a comprar sin dudar"

33,"Came in great condition. No scratches, lagging, or any defects. I‚Äôve been having the phone for about a month and it‚Äôs performing well. Also comes with a usb charger, block and some card remover."
34,My Grand Daughter was very impress and happy with it.
35,It just got here after a lil wait. Good looking phone in good shape looks just as shown just a couple of tiny nicks no big deal at all only thing I don‚Äôt like is that the battery is 80+ other than that . I‚Äôm pleased .
36,"Got it at a good price and working great. the shipping took more than a month, so I took one start out."
37,Son buenos pero creo que deber√≠an tener mejor la bater√≠a

39,My complaint is that the add said it has 8 gigs of RAM and only has 6. The sound is okay.
40,The phone has a big scratch I also had problems to start but know it‚Äôs working fine
41,good
42,"I successfully transitioned from my Android to this iPhone. However, I am still learning the many features of this phone. I have successfully added Apps with the exception of my Ecobee thermostat. Will tackle that App real soon with some assistance from Ecobee."
43,I can never afford the current iPhone but I recently upgraded to the 12 pro. I really like it. Works well!
44,"I am enjoying this refurbished iPhone. The price was right, and it perform like new. Easy to use and handle."
45,"BUen estado, un poco golpeado a los lados pero es mas estetico que otra cosa. Funciona perfecto y esta libre para trabajar en Colombia"
46,
47,"The phone comes in great condition. The only problem is the battery life. Be careful the description says the battery life is at least 80%. The phone comes in exactly 80%, which is a relatively low battery life and need to change battery ASAP."
48,Parece nuevo lo √∫nico que no me gust√≥ que la condici√≥n de la bater√≠a vino en un 83 % el resto todo bien
49,
50,La bateria llego al 80%.

52,"The delivery was fast. The phone was easy to set up. The only issue, is the battery only holds a charge for about 8 hours. That may be the result of my grand daughter on it all the time."
53,Phone was as advertised. It was totally unlocked and I was able to swap out my old SIM card from my iPhone 7 with no issues.
54,"El tel√©fono me ha salido muy bueno. No me costo transferir mis archivos de mi antiguo iPhone.
Solo tra√≠a un poco despegada la pantalla de una esquina, pero hay una persona que me ayudara a resolver ese peque√±o detalle."
55,
56,I've had this phone for a few weeks now and have had no issues! The battery came with an 85% charge rate which was expected. I would highly recommend this product if you're looking to get an IPhone for a fraction of the price!
57,"The renewed model I received had no visible scratches or signs of wear, which was impressive.

In terms of performance, the iPhone operates smoothly and efficiently, meeting my expectations for speed and functionality. The renewed device handled apps, multitasking, and everyday tasks with ease, just like a new iPhone would.

However, there was one aspect that left me slightly disappointed: the battery life. Upon checking, the battery capacity was at 80% of its original capacity. While this is understandable for a renewed device, it did mean that I needed to charge it more frequently than I would with a new iPhone."
58,Got a really good deal on a brand new iPhone from Amazon. Someone must‚Äôve opened the box and returned it new. Perfect condition and super happy with it.
59,"Excelente producto, lo ped√≠ desde Panam√° con mi casillero en Miami y llego en excelente estado. Compre dos productos al mismo tiempo y llegaron muy bien, tenemos 5 meses us√°ndolos y han estado en perfecto estado. No llegan es caja original pero a√∫n as√≠ esta bien empacado. Lo recomiendo al 100%"

61,"Muy buen producto bien cuidado en exelente condiciones. Very good product in excellent condition, thank you"
62,"Looks practically new, and everything the seller said it would be. I've very happy with this phone, and have gone through a few issues with other sellers with refurbished phones. So, I'm glad I finally found this!

I contacted the seller about a question and was answered in a very reasonable amount of time, and was very helpful and accommodating!

I give 5 stars for sure!"
63,"I have bought refurbished phones for family, and very happy. This phone was perfect."
64,"love love love so much cheaper than buying brand new. the condition was perfect and it works great. been using it for about a month now, no concerns or problems."
65,"Iphone 12 pro had an excellent score rating and when it arrived it was in near perfect condition. Battery life at 87%. Been using it for 5 days with absolutely no hiccups or issues. I was reluctant to buy a used phone but this turned out to be a great experience and saved me a lot of money. Also, it was prime next day delivery and arrived on time all the way from NJ and I'm in CA so that was awesome. I am very pleased. Thank you BidAllies!"
66,"Here's a review for a refurbished iPhone 12 Pro with poor voice quality and a depleted battery:

Title: Buyer Beware: Refurbished iPhone 12 Pro Falls Short

If you're in the market for a refurbished iPhone 12 Pro, proceed with caution with the units gor sale here. My recent experience with a supposedly ""certified"" refurbished unit from a third-party seller has been nothing short of disappointing.

Let's start with the voice quality. Despite being touted as ""like new,"" the voice quality during calls is abysmal. Voices sound muffled, and there's a constant static noise that makes conversations a struggle. In an age where crystal-clear audio is expected, this issue is simply unacceptable.

But the problems don't stop there. The battery life on this refurbished unit is a joke. After a mere few hours of moderate use, the battery drains alarmingly fast, leaving you tethered to a power source. And to make matters worse, the battery health has already depleted to a dismal 88% ‚Äì a far cry from the promised ""like new"" condition.

Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of this purchase is the lack of warranty coverage. Since the Apple warranty has expired, any issues that arise will be solely the responsibility of the new owner. That means costly repairs or replacement expenses down the line, effectively negating any potential savings from buying a refurbished device.

In conclusion, while the allure of a discounted refurbished iPhone 12 Pro is understandable, this particular unit fails to deliver on its promises. Poor voice quality, abysmal battery life, and the lack of warranty protection make this a purchase I cannot recommend. Unless you're willing to take a significant gamble, it's best to steer clear of this particular offering and explore alternative options."

78,"I liked it, this is my very first iPhone. With it being a refurbished phone, I have not had any problems so far while using it. The scratches were very minimum. I put a case on so nothing shows anyway. I‚Äôm satisfied with purchase."
79,No scratches and good enough battery life
80,"Great deal and works well, battery health was 90% and dropped to 89% pretty quickly, and the speaker is canny, but otherwise satisfied it‚Äôs probably Apple‚Äôs greatest phone and I can always replace the battery plus who ever uses the speaker on their iPhone use AirPods it‚Äôs not 2010"
81,"The phone arrived looking great but the battery was totally dead. After the first 2 hours of charging, it looked like it was not going to take a charge and then it started registering charging. No problem getting it activated with my phone carrier. After 1 hr of watching a video it had 90% battery left. I switched it to just LTE and not 5G all the time because I'm concerned about the frequencies being harmful. Text and email work without a problem. I don't know why they put all the cameras in it and then when you take a photo, they don't look that good. The depth and definition is not there. It's ok. Really don't see that it is any better than the XS I was using, if anything the camera is not as good."
82,"I purchased the Apple iPhone 12 Pro from Amazon as a birthday gift for my wife, and it has exceeded all expectations! Amazon offered a special price during a sale, making it an irresistible deal.

From the moment my wife unboxed it, she was thrilled. The sleek design, vibrant Super Retina XDR display, and premium feel make it a standout device. The camera quality is phenomenal, capturing stunning photos and videos that rival professional cameras. My wife loves the new Night mode and the enhanced portrait shots.

Performance-wise, the A14 Bionic chip ensures everything runs smoothly, from everyday tasks to more demanding apps. The battery life is impressive, easily lasting through her busy day.

Additionally, the 5G capability future-proofs the phone, ensuring it‚Äôs ready for the next wave of technology.

Overall, this purchase has been a huge hit, making my wife‚Äôs birthday even more special. Thank you, Amazon, for the fantastic deal and fast delivery. Highly recommend the iPhone 12 Pro!!!"
83,This iphone 12 pro came in excellent condition and i was very impressed with the shipping speed. the camera is great and it charges very fast. it seems very durable and i was able to set it up and lock it pretty much as soon as i got it.
84,"TLDR: Small chip above charging port (So minimal I don't care), 86% Maximum Capacity for battery

Was skeptical buying a refurbished phone, after seeing majority of reviews were solid and comparing my options I realized this could be the best option. The phone works great, and aside from that one very small chip I notice nothing else wrong with it."

104,I‚Äôve had my refurbished phone for about a week now. I haven‚Äôt noticed any problems with performance of the phone. I went through a lot of reviews. I was hesitant on a refurbished phone because there were so many mixed reviews about Amazon refurbished phone. I am a huge Amazon fan tho. And kept going. And realized there are different companies within the Amazon refurbished products. Specifically the one called Hybrid IT. Had excellent reviews and I felt very confident and comfortable going through them. I purchased one that was specifically in ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù condition. It really is apart from the scratch across the screen. Initially I was disappointed but I have a screen protector on it and I can‚Äôt really see it. The camera and lens were the most important part for me: and the whole reason for getting a Pro. The camera was good and no scratches on lens. The battery health came at 82%. I was hoping for a little better battery health. But as long as it lasts I think it will be okay.
105,
106,
107,"So I waited approximately 2 and a half weeks before this item was shipped. The phone works perfect. Speaker works- people can hear me and I hear them. Audio is really loud. Camera works great, touch works, Face ID works. A little scratches but nothing major which is actually impressive. You‚Äôd have to definitely be looking for them to see. The battery however came at 81% which isn‚Äôt good in my opinion, could‚Äôve been a solid 90% or 91% but it still works. Otherwise I have no complains or faults at all. Comes with a charger which charges the phone super fast. Value for money. At first I thought it was too small but I had a pro max version and the pro is a better fit for my small hands. Easy set up process. I have no complaints. If you always drop your phone, get a durable case and screen protector!!!"
108,Title says it all. I bought the phone to upgrade from an older iPhone and have it paid in full. Phone has been great and looks brand new.
109,Phone works great. 10 out of 10 for me.
110,"I‚Äôve had problems with the phone. I would make a call, the party would answer, i could hear them when the answered, but they couldn‚Äôt hear me. Had to go on u tube and got it corrected. I hope it keeps working!
When i first got the phone, it worked fine."
111,Everyday good performance and reception my husband over the road truck driver no problems communicating with him
112,Works fine
113,"I‚Äôve bought a iPhone 12 Pro 128gb in ‚Äúgood condition‚Äù the battery seems fine it‚Äôs at 84%, the performance is great, no heat issues, so far I have no bad issues with this phone it runs like a brand new phone I love it MCEsales"
114,"This phone was mint condition and very happy with it, I ordered two, an I13 pro as well and then one was bad with a cracked back and was rated the same as this one so some of the suppliers must not be Lalit in following the guidelines listed."
115,Received my refurbished phone and it was in excellent condition‚Ä¶no scratches and had a screen protector on it. Works the same as my original phone that I was replacing. Similar battery life.

117,"i recently received my phone today, and all i can say is that it is flawless, no scratches no nothing! however, when i was setting up with my phone i read that the battery health will be exactly at 80% or higher but i've received a 77% health battery. overall it is great and amazing and i would recommend for people who wants to save up money and being able to afford a phone :-)"
