1,"buying a used phone can be an anxiety filled experience  you read the reviews and hope that youre one of the happy customers and are lucky enough to get an as advertised product you have to take a chance i did and the phone arrived quickly and with an unexpected charger and cord  generic box and bubble wrap the phone was listed as in excellent and it truly was without a mark dent or scratch
several hours of backing up transferring data and sim  now the phone is truly working and picking up where the prior phone handed off to the latest one
the challenge of course is you have a new phone  and its always a bit steep for the first few days trying to learn the new hardwaresoftware and audit that the used phone does not have some hidden defect that is going to cost you more time and money so im happy for a few days and then one evening i discover that the bottom speaker the top earpiece speaker is actually called the receiver was not working well scratchy and little to no volume  this had missed my attention entirely a panic search online revealed apple 12 speaker problems and them being repaired by apple  crap
i went to a repair shop the next day they ran apple diagnostics on the phone and sure enough  speaker needed to be replaced  120 for generic parts 180 for apple parts  theyre not familiar with the apple repair program found out later that was for receiver speakers  so this is half of the cost of the phone
no im committed to the new phone dont want to lose it but dont want to pay this either
reach out to seller and explain the issue  they can even confirm the apple diagnostic through the serial number  they offer 25 refund if ill keep the phone  so this tells me that they dont run diagnostics on the phones themselves  or do and hope that people will simply miss small items or accept them once they have sweat equity in the phone  or its all honest and by buyingselling a used phone both parties are taking a gamble i chose to believe the latter and accepted their offer
and heres the takeaway  the speaker now works  once in a while i might think i hear some scratchy but unsure due to surrounding conditions so for now its good well see how long it lasts  but if i have to get it repaired  i took a chance 
i say take a chance  you might get a perfect phone and save a lot in the meantime  i typically stay a few models behind the curve and benefit from software updates and people abandoning perfectly working phones for the latest models  att is a great place to buy and sell used phones  i have bought and sold several phones there and have never had a bad experience
I bought a used iPhone 12 Pro Max from a seller on eBay. The phone was advertised as being in excellent condition, but when I received it, I noticed that the screen was cracked. I contacted the seller and they offered to refund my money, but I decided to keep the phone because I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it and waiting for a new one to arrive. The seller also offered to replace the screen for me, but I declined because I didn't want to spend any more money on the phone.
I've been using the phone for a few weeks now and I'm happy"

3,"i wanted to wait a couple months before writing a review so here it is

you get what you pay for for sure phone came with an 80 battery capacity a little disappointing but it is what it is

then i noticed it overheats fast phone was still operational of course but it was kind of just annoying

then finally my imessage started cutting in and out this was what did it for me lol my imessage would just stop working completely for hours on end and i finally was like oooookay time for another phone

overall however phone came in beautiful condition no dents no scratches or dings and it worked great aside from my imessage going in and out there might be just some things needing fixing upon purchase hope this helps had this phone for a year and works completely fine got blue went to my phone servicer and got it turned on immediately its legit and yes its a iphone fast shipping phone looks brand new easy to set up fully unlocked no battery issues ive had the phone only a few days but so far very satisfied and everything was as advertised was a little skeptical at first but this was 100 percent worth it the phone itself looked brand new and came with a chord and charger turned on and activated with no issues what so ever i just needed to do a full reset phone came with a battery life of 86 so not to bad well worth it so far after a couple months the phone seems to work good but the battery life is terrible it shows it has good battery health but dies really fast i ordered the phone and everything was great until i tried to transfer my service and it didnt work  i thought okay maybe its just that service provider so i used a different one that still didnt work  i looked in my settings only to find that it had a carrier lock on it mind you i bought this fully unlocked i emailed them to figure what the carrier was and i havent heard back for weeks  after i contacted the seller assistant they reached out and immediately fixed the issue and my phone is up and running perfectly the item is being returned this was a good value for the price but unfortunately the sim is not compatible with verizon i will not wait for verizon to send a physical sim card the following statement copied from the sales page is not true fully unlocked and compatible with any carrier of choice eg att tmobile sprint verizon uscellular cricket metro etc57

update i was able to use this phone by activating on mint mobile it does not work for verizon but this will work as an alternative the phone is in excellent condition as described the phone is in excellent condition as described the phone is in excellent condition as described the phone is in excellent condition as described the phone is in excellent condition as described the phone is in excellent condition as described the phone is in excellent condition as described the phone is in excellent condition as described the phone is in excellent condition as described the phone is in excellent condition as described the phone is in excellent condition as described the phone is in excellent condition as described the phone is in excellent condition as described the phone is in excellent condition as described the phone is in excellent condition as described the phone is in excellent condition as described the phone is in excellent condition as described the phone is in excellent condition as described the phone is in excellent condition as"
4,"the first one i received was doa the second one was absolutely perfectno marks or scratchesbattery was at 93 change over was quick and easy nearly cosmetically perfect
no scratches on screen
battery health at 97
everything works perfect
the unboxing was just as satisfying as if it had been in a new apple box
i love it
the only little thing i would mention is i feel like it could have been cleaned just a bit better there was still some dust and lint in the nooks and crannies that i had to get myself but thats okay definitely worth it for everything else no scratches and good enough battery life cleanminimal scratches works great with serveral cases and screen protectors
